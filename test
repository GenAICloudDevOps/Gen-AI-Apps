# Natural Language Processing (NLP): A Comprehensive Learning Guide

## 1. Introduction to NLP

### What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It aims to enable computers to understand, interpret, generate, and manipulate human language in valuable ways.

### Key Objectives of NLP
- Enable machines to read and understand human language
- Convert unstructured text data into structured, analyzable information
- Facilitate communication between humans and machines

### 3.2 Sentiment Analysis
**Definition:** Determining the emotional tone behind a series of words.

**Python Example:**
```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    sentiment = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
    if sentiment > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif sentiment < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"

reviews = [
    "This product is amazing!",
    "I'm disappointed with the service.",
    "The experience was okay."
]

for review in reviews:
    print(f"Review: {review}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {analyze_sentiment(review)}")
```

### 3.3 Text Classification
**Definition:** Categorizing text documents into predefined classes.

**Python Example using scikit-learn:**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Training data
X_train = [
    "I love this movie",
    "Great film, highly recommended",
    "Terrible experience, would not watch again",
    "Worst movie ever"
]
y_train = ['positive', 'positive', 'negative', 'negative']

# Create a pipeline
text_clf = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
    ('classifier', MultinomialNB())
])

# Train the model
text_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
X_test = ["This movie was fantastic"]
predictions = text_clf.predict(X_test)
print(f"Prediction: {predictions[0]}")
```
